Introduction
Diseases in tomato plants are a significant challenge for agriculture, reducing yield and affecting food quality. Identifying diseases early helps in taking prompt measures to minimize crop loss. This project automates disease detection by analyzing leaf images, providing a valuable tool for the agriculture industry.

Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of tomato leaves in various health conditions, including diseased and healthy categories.

Source: PlantVillage Dataset, if applicable (or the actual source used).
Classes: This model detects diseases such as bacterial spots and may differentiate between other conditions if more classes are included.
Model Architecture
The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Python with TensorFlow/Keras. The architecture is designed for high accuracy in image classification.

Layers: Convolutional layers with max pooling for feature extraction, followed by dense layers for classification.
Activation Function: ReLU activation is used in the hidden layers, while softmax is applied in the output layer to classify the diseases.
Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy, suitable for multi-class classification.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer is used for efficient gradient descent.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Jupyter Notebook (if running the project in a notebook environment)
To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/tomato-leaf-disease-detection.git
cd tomato-leaf-disease-detection
Run the Jupyter Notebook Open disease_detection_in_tomato_leaves_using_CNN.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook, and execute the cells to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Inference To test the model on new images, use an image of a tomato leaf, load it as an input, and run the prediction cells to classify it as healthy or diseased.

Results
The model achieves high accuracy on the test set, effectively distinguishing between healthy and diseased leaves. Key performance metrics include:

Accuracy: Provide final accuracy score, e.g., 95%
Precision & Recall: (Optional) Include metrics if available
Sample Outputs: Display a few sample images with the modelâ€™s predictions to demonstrate accuracy.
Future Improvements
Potential improvements for this project could include:

Training on a larger dataset to improve robustness.
Adding more disease categories to make the model comprehensive.
Implementing data augmentation techniques to further enhance accuracy.
Deploying the model as a web or mobile app for easier access.
